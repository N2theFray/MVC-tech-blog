## Musings
I had a great time with this application process as it was the first time that we've built an entire full-stack site from scratch. The process of building this really helped cement the teachings of this week's modules and previous ones. The entire handlebar and routing process makes so much more sense to me now. I didn't run into any problems that were insurmountable, and as always its a continual learning experience. One new thing I picked up was the difference between 'click' and 'submit' type buttons. I had originally thought that 'submit' was for input of information (which it may still be), but apparently it constrains the 'event' to the location of the button whereas 'click' allows clicking anywhere on the div. tricky tricky.
